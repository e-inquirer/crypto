# crypto
Caesar and Vigen√®re cipher POC; implemented via Python 3.5.2


# TO DO:
+ clean up vigenere.py cipher function signature
\-- multiple embedded if/else should be done away with and simplified

+ modify alphabet_position() and rotate_character() functions
\-- apply dictionary type
	\-- decide between:
		\-- dictionary methods (20.2)
		\-- aliasing and copying (20.3)
		\-- and sparse matrices (20.4)
	\-- refer to: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/dictionaries.html 

+ add testEqual modules to crypto directory
\-- document installation and environment setup README.md

+ improve test stubs
\-- refactor to operate through 'for' loops
	\-- $i will iterate through alphabet chars
	\-- use rand() to generate random 'rots'
		\-- $x should correspond to rand() so as to produce 'expected' test result

+ modify string-to-character functions
\-- simplify by using type conversion via type constructor list()

# B/G:
+ caeser cipher algorithm is simple to implement, but susceptible to frequency analysis, or brute-force attack at the very least
\-- vigen[e accente-gue]re is an example of a more complex substitution cipher
	\-- uses multiple shift values rather than one, utilizing a string key rather than a single value
	\-- despite this, it is still susceptible to being broken, if the attacker is aware of the length of the cipher key
		\-- the cipher text is simply treated as the product of an interwoven caeser ciphers
			\-- repeated cipher text patterns indicate repeated terms in the unencrypted text message
	\-- whereas caeser cipher presents 25 possibilities to evaluated, vigenere presents [(26^n) - 1], possibilites
		\-- where 'n' is length of the unknown key, and (-1) removes the possibility of a key composed entirely from a single character 
		\-- difficult, but feasible for a dedicated attacker
